# ALUCARD: Revolutionizing Password Management (Work in Progress)

Welcome to ALUCARD, a  blockchain project aiming to transform how we manage password-related data securely.

## Overview

ALUCARD, or Advanced Ledger for Unified Cryptographic Access and Resilient Decentralization, embodies the core principles of our innovative blockchain architecture:

- **Advanced Ledger:** Records and stores transactions securely for managing password information with transparency and accuracy.
- **Unified Cryptographic Access:** Implements secure access mechanisms, ensuring only authorized users manage their data.
- **Resilient Decentralization:** Distributes data across multiple nodes for heightened security and resistance against unauthorized access.

## Challenges with Traditional Systems

Traditional password management systems face various vulnerabilities:

- **Centralized Vulnerability:** Risky reliance on centralized servers.
- **Single Point of Failure:** Potential disruptions due to server breaches or downtime.
- **Privacy Concerns:** Users hesitant about third-party access to sensitive data.
- **Limited Transparency:** Lack of clarity regarding data handling and security measures.
- **Cumbersome Recovery:** Inefficient processes for lost password retrieval.

## Features

- **Decentralization:** Distributed network ensures data integrity.
- **Secure Transactions:** Blockchain protects sensitive password data.
- **User Authentication:** Robust mechanism for authorized access.
- **Password Encryption:** Strong encryption for data security.
- **Efficient Access:** Quick retrieval with minimal latency.
## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Before using ALUCARD, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.12
- `venv`
### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/odd509/alucard.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd alucard
```

3. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Blockchain Overview
ALUCARD utilizes a blockchain to store and manage password-related transactions securely. Each block in the blockchain contains a set of encrypted password transactions. Smart contracts (if applicable) enforce transaction rules, ensuring secure data handling and accessibility.
